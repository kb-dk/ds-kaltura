## [Unreleased]

### Changed
- DsKalturaClient is now split into two classes. An abstract class called DsKalturaClientBase and DsKalturaClient 
  that extends DsKalturaClientBase. DsKalturaClientBase maintains kaltura sessions, generically builds and sends API 
  requests to kaltura and unpacks API responses. This serves to reduce the responsibilities and complexity of each 
  method residing in child classes.

### Added

## [3.0.1] (https://github.com/kb-dk/ds-kaltura/releases/tag/ds-kaltura-3.0.1) - 2025-07-07
### Changed
- Config to use sessionDurationSeconds and sessionRefreshThreshold instead of keepAliveSeconds. 
  KeepAliveSeconds is now calculated from these two parameters and sessionDurationSeconds is used when starting a 
  session.
- Changed KeepAliveSession from long to int.
- Changed startWidgetSession to take a nullable Integer to set specific Expiry. This should not be lower than 600 
  due to Kaltura caching of responses.  

### Added
- Added getSessionInfo that logs sessionInfo. Only used for testing.
